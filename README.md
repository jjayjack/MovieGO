# MovieGO
  
 
  ## Description:
  For this initial project, our group decided that we wanted to create an application that would allow a user to select preferences and be given a suggested movie. Our motivation for this project came from the impact of the pandemic: most people had been in lock down or limited opportunity to leave their house. To pass the time most relied on internet services for entertainment and with that, most would start and fly through their favorites and interesting titles to watch. To combat this, we introduced MovieGo, relying on The Movie Database API we navigated a collection of inputs from our user's selection and rendered a movie suggestion. During this project, our team learned about how to use an API, making API calls, using Bootstrap for our front-end, and the initial connection of user input and displaying a suggestion from the API.

  ## Installation:
  To begin we utilized basic JavaScript, noUI sliders, jQuery, and wNumb. This project relies on basic HTML and JavaScript components.

  ## Usage:
  To use, our main function (getMovie) will collect the user's responses then run an API call to display the suggested movie. Within the suggestMovie function, the JavaScript also works to append HTML components on the page next to the user's selections.
